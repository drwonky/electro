# Drawings

The original Electro Automotive drawings were organized by make, model, year range, and sometimes displacement.  Because many engine and transmission combinations are used in different models of vehicle, an attempt is made to organize first by engine manufacturer and engine family code.  The translation may be a little rough because the full application data for each drawing was lost.

- `by_engine_code` - These are hub, assembly (ring), and adapter plate drawings organized by manufacturer and engine code.
- `by_make_model` - This is a hierarchy organized by make, model, and engine displacement.  This attempts to preserve the original Electro Automotive organization.

TODO:
- Complete the make/model/displacement hierarchy based on original drawing notes.
- Add a make/model/year hierarchy based on original drawing notes.
