## Contents

- `dxf_in` - These are drawings that were provided by Electro Automotive to produce machined articles.  These are mostly proper but need to be categorized.
- `dxf_out` - These are drawings that were generated by EFormance Engineering (me) as part of the transmission adapter pattern digitization process.  These need to be properly finished, cleaned up, annotated, and categorized.
- `gxd_in` - These are original General CADD Pro source drawings from Electro Automotive.  They need conversion to DXF and sorting.  There appear to be a large number of "Component" drawings, which may be useful to convert also.
- `drawings` - These are hub, assembly (ring), and adapter plate drawings.
