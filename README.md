## Contents

- `dxf_in` - These are drawings that were provided by Electro Automotive to produce machined articles.  These are mostly proper but need to be categorized.
- `dxf_out` - These are drawings that were generated by EFormance Engineering (me) as part of the transmission adapter pattern digitization process.  These need to be properly finished, cleaned up, annotated, and categorized.
- `gxd_in` - These are original General CADD Pro source drawings from Electro Automotive.  They need conversion to DXF and sorting.  There appear to be a large number of "Component" drawings, which may be useful to convert also.
- `hub_assy_pdf_scans` - These are raw scans of the hub and assembly drawings that were used by EFormance Engineering to produce adapters and hubs.  Several of the drawings have as-built revisions to dimensions to correct errors or add missing dimensions.  These drawings must be sorted and (eventually) converted from a plot back to a DXF.
